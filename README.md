- 👋 Hi, I’m Yifei Cao, a master's student of the quantitative economics program at UCLA. I'm pursuing a data analytics / data science track.
- 👀 I previously worked as a data analyst for two years. And I've been interacting with R, VBA and SQL. Now I’m wishing to become a data scientist in California after graduation in December 2023.
- 🌱 I’m wishing to leverage my machine learning techniques here, with an enthusiastic  in deep learning and neural network. And I will post my most recent projects in my GitHub profile to keep track of progress. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects, data mining projects, and other data science-related projects
